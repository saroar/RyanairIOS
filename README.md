This is a project demonstrating the capabilities of [The Composable Architecture (TCA)](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) and Swift Package Manager.
TCA allows developers to fully encapsulate state, actions and environment to control its side effects.

This allows for easier dependency management where we can have more control of what goes where when needed.

Compared to other ways of building and developing applications, TCA allows for building new **Features** in parallel in a big team.
Productivity increases while cognitive load stays at a manageable level.
